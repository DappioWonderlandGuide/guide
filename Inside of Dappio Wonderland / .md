## Platform Incentives

How to receive rewards on Dappio Wonderland? 

### Staking:

$DAPC stakers receive more $DAPC when they staked. 

### Locking Six/Twelve (6/12) months with 4 benefits:

- Earn more $CARROT: Just like staking, locking can earn more $DAPC. 
- Share Platform Fee:  Lock can also **receive a share of platform fees** based on the periods your lock. 
- Share Penalty Fee: Because you are committed to the Dappio Wonderland by being locked for Six/Twelve (6/12) months, you will also receive penalty fees from those exiting their vests early. Longer period received higher Penalty fee, which means higher yields.
- Govern Dappio: Once $DAPC holders lock their $DAPC, they can start voting on various DAO proposals and pool parameters.

 
### Liquidity Mining (Farm $CARROT)     

The $DAPC rewards are distributed evenly between liquidity providers of the $DAPC pools. Rewards for the pools are distributed based on the overall TVL of the pools, therefore the APYs of these pools are identical.
