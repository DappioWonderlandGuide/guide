## What is PROVE TOKEN/FARM TOKEN?
Once you start NFT staking, you should see PROVE TOKEN/FARM TOKEN in your wallet. PROVE TOKEN means you have already Staked your NFT on our staking program. FARM TOKEN means you are going to start mining $NFTU rewards on our mining program.

We have list down Name/Symbol/Address/Logo from each PROVE TOKEN/FARM TOKEN.

## IMPORTANT!! Some Reminder when you Staking
When you stake your NFT on Dappio, you simply will get a PROVE TOKEN for your NFT which then will be deposited into our Mining Program in exchange for a FARM TOKEN to begin your journey earning $NFTU.

While this process is automated, there are still a few things to keep in mind!

1. Please DO NOT transfer/burn the PROVE TOKEN or the FARM TOKEN

2. Please keep the PROVE TOKEN or the FARM TOKEN in your wallet because they are essential for the unstaking process.

3. If you have multiple NFT to stake, please stake maximum of 3 NFT at one time (This maximum allowance will increase on our next patch when Solana network is more stable)

4. If you encounter a message saying ‚ÄúPhantom believes this transaction is malicious and unsafe to sign. We have disabled the ability to sign it in order to protect you and your funds‚Äù, Don‚Äôt worry, your NFT and funds are SAFU with Dappio. Make sure you are staking from the official link: https://app.dappio.xyz/nft-staking

5. IF THE STAKE BUTTON IS ORANGE CLICK IT AGAIN! This means due to the Solana network, some of your PROVE TOKEN failed to start mining $NFTU, or failed to return FARM TOKEN from Farm pool. Please try again by clicking Stake button. If you have staked all your Dappies Successfully that button should disappear.
