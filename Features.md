# Features

A walk-through to use our product
Here are the features you can use in Dappio Wonderland: 

### Gateways (Wallet): 
To get started on Dappio Wonderland, you will need a wallet that supports the Solana blockchain. There are several great wallets to choose from in the ecosystem, so it should be easy to find the one that fits your needs best. Currently, we support Phantom, Sollet, Solflare, and Coin98 wallet as Dappio wonderland gateways.

### Dashboard: 
Dappio features a dashboard that can view and manage different aspects of your portfolio, such as farms, strategy, and staking pools. Our dashboard makes it easy to keep track of volumes and APY across Solana.
Swap (DEX Aggregator Coming Soon):
Dappio aggregates the major DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) on Solana. Users can trade confidently, without needing to leave the platform to compare exchange rates from different DEXs and centralized exchanges.

### Farm: 
In our farming club, 🐰 may easily obtain high yields using different protocols on Solana by staking a liquidity provider (LP) token and earning 🥕 token rewards. Dappio provides a one-click farming button for you to easily zap your token into our farming club.

### Borrow/Lend: 
In our Lending Club, 🐰 have access to all top lending protocols on Solana and can easily pick up the highest lending APY protocols.
Strategy Hub: 
In our Strategy Hub, we aggregate a multitude of Solana DeFi platforms and strategies in one place and make it easier than ever to find the best yields. In our Strategy Hub, 🐰 can easily choose the top strategy vaults on Solana Ecosystem. We make sure all 🐰 can earn yield and 🥕 regardless of market volatility. 

### Leverage: 
In Crypto Asset trading, leveraging is a strategy that relies on using borrowed tokens to increase the potential return on an investment. If a leveraged token gives its holder 2x price exposure to SOL, then if the SOL price increases by 10% today, the price of that leveraged token should increase close to 20%. 
TVL Ranking / On-Chain Data: 
Dappio provides real-time TVL ranking and on-chain data for 🐰 to better clarify the market status of DeFi protocols.

### Easy to claim rewards: 
Dappio Wonderland provides a shortcut for all 🐰 to claim rewards through our integrated and easy to use platform.
