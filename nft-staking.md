Dappio Wonderland provides users to earn yield across Defi / NFT offerings. Therefore, allowing all Solana NFT to stake on Dappio has always been part of our mission and roadmap.

We believe the future of NFT will interchangeably interact with Defi products; and to create a friendly, trusted environment for holders to stake; Dappio Wonderland becomes an important puzzle to Solana ecosystem.

Each staked NFT earns **10** $NFTU/day and accmumlates $NFTU over time. Once claimed, you'll be able to use these utility tokens for Auction, Raffles and upcoming mints in the future.

Now we have partner with Sovana, Monkey Kingdom and support user to stake their NFT from Sovana and Monkey Kingin Dappio to earn $NFTU soon. Stay tuned for our development and more $NFTU / NFT Staking partnership update.
