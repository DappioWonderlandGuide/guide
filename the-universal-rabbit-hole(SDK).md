# The Universal Rabbit Hole 


![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1N9TARi5.jpg)


## Introduction
One of the challenges people often talk about when it comes to Solana is its composability. While some contracts are open source, majority aren't, making it almost impossible to build projects on Solana with mass adoption potential. Interacting with DeFi or NFTs on Solana shouldn't be hard, which is why Dappio created the Universal Rabbit Hole.

Dappio is dedicated to making Solana easy and bringing top developers into the Solana ecosystem. Our Universal Rabbit Hole provides developers with a plug-and-play program "gateway" for a basket of smart contracts. Versatile enough to accommodate Farm, Vault, money market, and other DeFi needs, Universal Rabbit Hole empowers users to build their ideal projects on Solana.

The following diagram shows an overview of Universal Rabbit Hole:

## Our Solution

### Composability as a Service

Universal Rabbit Hole make DeFi / NFT programs "composable" on Solana, which allows anyone in the network to take existing programs and adapt or build on top of them. This means that developers on Solana can easily put their own projects together without having to build everything from scratch. 

Universal Rabbit Hole unlocks previously unimaginable DeFi / NFT use-cases thanks to the power of composability. In other words, Universal Rabbit Hole provides convenience for the developers building on DeFi protocols, as well as accelerates DeFi innovation throughout the whole Solana ecosystem. You can easily plug Universal Rabbit Hole into various DeFi protocols like Lego pieces, assembling novel DeFi services that are easy for users to navigate. Imagine a developer leveraging Universal Rabbit Hole to connect Radyium Swap + Saber LP + Tulip Vaults, creating an innovative DeFi product on these services. Projects like this naturally lead to more DeFi choice and better user experiences in the Solana ecosystem. 


### Interface
Universal Rabbit Hole functions as an interface between service providers and all on-chain protocol providers. It makes the complexity of dealing with different protocols manageable, which allows service providers to focus on their DeFi application model. To Simply put, with Universal Rabbit Hole handles protocol integration, teams can allow user experiences front-and-center. 

Dappio has already integrated several major protocols on Solana, including Farm/Money Market/Leverage/Swap/Vaults and more. Instead of diving into those protocols' SDKs individually, developers can save an immense amount of time by using Universal Rabbit Hole.

Every SDK is different. Figuring out and interacting with each one takes time. If your project involves multiple SDKs, all of that time can start to add up. With just a few lines of code, Universal Rabbit Hole dramatically reduces development complexity. The diagram below shows how this complexity is reduced:

## Examples 

| TA/Issue |Pain Point(Before)|Solution(After)|Example| 
| - | - | - | - | 
|Protocols|Try to find out how to acquire more TVL and exposure in efficient way| Universal Rabbit Hole provides integration framework for Protocols to build composable service Adapter. | Dappio aggregate more users to increase TVL through Dappio DeFi Platform. | 
|Developers|Limited open source from Protocol on Solana; Inefficient to read different types of SDK to build| Universal Rabbit Hole saves time spent reading/trying those protocol SDKs individually. | Easier to build a Zap-in Function(Swap on Jupiter, Add LP on Saber, Staked on Farm pool) and create Auto-compounding vaults on Tulip or Francium | 
|DeFi users| Limited DeFi choice on Solana| More DeFi innovation protocols available, with better user experience on Solana ecosystem |More Protocols on Solana can build on top of Dappio to create the best yields and model for users to choose and earn ideal returns | 


## Summary

Universal Rabbit Hole provides a multi-function platform for both users and developers to experience all that DeFi on Solana has to offer. Universal Rabbit Hole acts as the middleware that aggregates multiple top DeFi protocols into one upgradable program layer. This structure allows developers to realize the full potential of Decentralized Finance on Solana. 

Dappio Wonderland is developer-friendly, and caters to teams of any size. It doesn't matter if you're a solo programmer or a scaled team, we got you covered. Our core team and broader community look forward to helping you build on Solana. Universal Rabbit Hole will be available for individuals, developers, and protocols in Q3 of 2022.
