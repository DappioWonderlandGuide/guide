## Wonderland Vaults

Vaults are the core of the Dappio. In our vaults club, Dappio generate yield for your assets by earning compound interest on users crypto assets farming. Our vaults automatically maximizes rewards from various liquidity pools(RAY-SOL, SOL-USDC, etcâ€¦), yield products or single assets in Solana ecosystem. Users can choose **auto-compound** investment so the vaults will automatically increase your deposited token amount by compounding yield farming rewards back to your initially deposited LPs. For example, vaults where one can stake SOL-USDC LP will result in more SOL-USDC LP over time, effectively growing your share in the vault and thus allowing for more and more rewards over time. By using a Dappio vault to compound your gains, you save thousands of transactions with their associated gas costs, and precious personal time. Instead of manually harvesting and selling rewards, buying more tokens, and reinvesting that continuously, a vault does all that automatically at a high frequency.
